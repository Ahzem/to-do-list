# To-Do List Application

This To-Do List application is a simple yet powerful tool to manage day-to-day tasks with the added functionality of setting due dates and times, similar to professional project management tools like Trello or GitHub Projects. It is built using the MVC architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns between the model (data), view (UI), and controller (logic).

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a description, due date, and time.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Click on a task to toggle its completion status, striking it through if completed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in local storage, so they persist between sessions.

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Simply clone this repository and open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahzem/to-do-list.git
cd to-do-list

## Usage

1. **Adding a Task**:
